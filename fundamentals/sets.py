set1 ={1,23,4,5,6,7,8,9,0 , 9, 9, 9, 9}
print(set1)
# 9 is repeated 4 times but set will only take one value
# set will only take unique values
set2 ={1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0}

print(set1.union(set2))
print(set1.intersection(set2))
# union will give all the values of both the sets
# intersection will give the common values between the two sets

#  it is just like the hashsey of java
